# iOS Networking Repository

This repository contains four apps students will build during the iOS Networking course:

- Lesson 1: SleepingInTheLibrary
- Lesson 2: FlickFinder
- Lesson 3: MyFavoriteMovies
- Lesson 4: TheMovieManager

Each app is split into branches that correspond to steps/checkpoints within their respective lessons. For example, 'step-1.1-init-sleeping' is the branch for the first step in Lesson 1 for SleepingInTheLibrary.

That's it. Have fun!
